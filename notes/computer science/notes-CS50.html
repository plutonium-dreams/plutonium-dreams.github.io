                <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>
                    Input -> Algorithm -> Output
                </p>

                <h3>Binary</h3>
                <p>
                   All code and information is represented in binary (base-2) inside a computer which is an abstraction of the prescence and abscence of electricity (On - 1, Off - 2). This is facilitated by transistors (tiny little switches). <br />
                    <em>important note!! people do not count all zero bits as a state (ex. 2 bit machine in 00 is not a state); thus, there is 2<sup>n</sup>-1 number of states that bits can be in a system (instead of 4 states in a 2 bit system, there is only 3)</em>
                </p>

                <h3>ASCII</h3>
                <p>
                    A number (in binary) is mapped to a specific letter (typically in 8 bits) in a system known as ASCII.
                </p>

                <h3>Unicode</h3>
                <p>
                    8 bytes are not enough for all of the characters used for the world's languages. Unicode is a superset that solves this problem by using 16, 24, or 32 bits for each character (4-billion possible characters). This system is represented through "Unicode code point" that utilizes hexadecimal (base-16) [ex. U+1F602]. <em>Variations in emojis utilizes multiple combinations of Unicode code points to solve the problem (like with the google keyboard emoji combinations).</em>
                </p>

                <h3>Color</h3>
                <p>
                    Different amounts of red, green, and blue are used to represent a color in a computer. These are also the same three colors present in a pixel and controlled by a computer. 3 values (in binary) are used to represent the values of each of these 3 colors. 
                </p>

                <h3>Representation</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Notice that there is no difference in representing characters and colors, it's all just 0s and 1s. As such, different programs interpret the binary differently. *Context Matters*</strong><br /><br />
                    
                    Various mediums are really just represented by a series of 0s and 1s
                </p>

                <h3>Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    A series of steps to used to solve a problem. Algorithms must be optimized for efficiency in order to be able to deal with large data sets (like picking the center of a set with a target then choosing the center of one of its subsets that contains the target and repeating). 
                </p>

                <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to be very specific with each step. You need to anticipate outcomes that might happen in order to minimize crashes.
                    These are comprised of functions, loops, and conditionals.
                </p>

                <h3>AI</h3>
                <p>
                    Chatbots cannot create the answer for every anticipated question using if statements due to the complex nature of language. The solution used for this are LLMs, giving a general purpose and letting it figure out and with pertubations to the output (although this is prone to hallucinations). <br /><a href="cs50.ai">CS50 Duck</a> will be used for the course as an AI based tutor(no other generative ai will be used/allowed). 
                </p>

                <h3>Scratch</h3>
                <p>
                    Scratch is a visual programming language that will be utilized for this week. It has code abstracted as blocks, allowing people to learn programming without the distractions of syntax. It has a cartesian plane for display with 0,0 as the center and 240,180 as maximum relative values. White ovals inside functions are called parameters/argument which customizes the output of a function.

                <h3>Programming Advice</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Splitting a large project into multiple managable subsets allows for ease of implementing and programming. Taking baby steps towards the goal, essentially. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Simplifying using abstracting allows us to focus on what matters and not the implementation details (functions). 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reduce stuff you want to intuitive ideas into just basic building blocks to guide with implementing these ideas in code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Take incremental steps. Don't implement everything from the get go. Have multiple versions for each major update.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repeating yourself in programming is not good design. Use loops instead.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
